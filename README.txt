== Description ==

This plugin will help you manage and display post series more easily. You'll be able to create/assign series and display other posts in the series.

It consists of a custom taxonomy (`post-series`) and two shortcodes `[post_series_block]` and `[post_series_nav]`.

It will automatically display a list of posts in the series at the top of a post and a link to the next post in the series when applicable.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `post-series-manager` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Start adding series tags to your posts like you would a regular tag

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I don't want it to show up before/after/somewhere else, what do I do? =

The plugin is set up in such a way that the content filters that are put in place can be removed fairly simply. Add one, or both, of the following to your functions.php:

    // Remove the shortcode that's automatically added before the content
    remove_filter( 'the_content', array( $post_series_manager, 'post_series_before' ) );
    // Remove the shortcode that's automatically added after the content
    remove_filter( 'the_content', array( $post_series_manager, 'post_series_after' ) );

= How do I use the shortcodes? =

The shortcodes are simple and have no additional parameters to use. The shortcodes that are available are:

* [post_series_block] - this is normally added before the content
* [post_series_nav] - this is normally added after the content

= Can I filter stuff? =

A number of filters have been included, and more are to follow.

The filters that are included (subject to change):
    // Filters "This post of part of the series: " text
    post-series-manager-series-text

    // Filters the " (Current)" text
    post-series-manager-current-text

    // Filters the "Continue reading this series:" text
    post-series-manager-next-text 

== Screenshots ==

1. An example of a list of posts in a series, automatically placed at the top of a post.
2. An example of a call to action at the end of a post, only shows up if there is a next post in the series.
3. Adding a post to a series is as simple as adding a tag to it.
